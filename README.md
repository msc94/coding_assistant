# Coding Assistant

## Introduction

Coding Assistant is an advanced Python-based project designed to streamline and automate various coding tasks. By leveraging different types of intelligent agents and powerful tools, Coding Assistant aims to enhance developer productivity and code quality.

## Project Overview

Coding Assistant utilizes a system of specialized agents (orchestrator, planner, and developer) working in tandem to automate coding processes. These agents, combined with a set of powerful tools, can assist in various tasks such as code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

## Features

- Multi-agent system (orchestrator, planner, developer) for intelligent task handling
- Automated code generation and refactoring
- Integrated file searching using ripgrep
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Strong typing with mypy for improved code quality
- Comprehensive test suite using pytest
- Custom logging for enhanced debugging and monitoring

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding_assistant.git
   cd coding_assistant
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set up direnv for environment management (optional):
   ```
   direnv allow
   ```

## Usage Guide

1. Start the Coding Assistant:
   ```
   python -m coding_assistant
   ```
2. [Explain how to interact with the assistant, e.g., through a CLI or GUI]
3. Example commands or operations:
   - [Provide examples of how to use different features]
