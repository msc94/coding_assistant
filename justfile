review:

If you find issues, ask the client if you should fix them. If you fix something, commit the changes and continue reviewing. Check if there already exists a PR for the branch using the \`gh\` tool. If yes, check if the existing PR has a proper description and title. If not, change the title and description to something more appropriate, again using the \`gh\` tool."
